# Class Notes

### [2018-09-12](Class%20Examples/2018-09-12/)
* Introductions
* Why study Computer Science and what is Physical Computing
* How do we interact with machines?
* HW: No Homework, but get the book.

### [2018-09-13](Class%20Examples/2018-09-13/)
* Electricity: voltage, current, conductivity, resistance, AC/DC, open/short circuits
* HW: Read Meet the Circuit

### [2018-09-17](Class%20Examples/2018-09-17/)
* Breadboard overview
* Build a simple circuit
* Series vs Parallel
* HW: Read Your Arduino

### [2018-09-18](Class%20Examples/2018-09-18/)
* Installing Arduino IDE
* Review Blink program
* Build Blink circuit
* No HW: Yom Kipur

### [2018-09-20](Class%20Examples/2018-09-20/)
* Review blink circuit
* Modify to traffic light circuit
* HW: Program traffic light

### [2018-09-24](Class%20Examples/2018-09-24/)
* Review traffic light program
* Introduce analogWrite
* Introduce variables (int)
* Introduce conditionals (if/then)
* HW: Modify the code from class today to fade a light up and down. If you aren't able to make it work, write a comment in your code explaining what you tried and what your reasoning was. Submit your program before class tomorrow.

### [2018-09-25](Class%20Examples/2018-09-25/)
* Review fading LED
* Inspect Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) using the oscilloscope
* HW: Read pages 193-205 (Switches, LEDs, and More) from Learn Electronics with Arduino. Build and test the circuit described.

### [2018-09-27](Class%20Examples/2018-09-27/)
* Review button
* Introduce digitalRead, Serial.begin(), and Serial.println()
* HW: Modify the code from class so that the LED is normally on, but when you press the button it turns off for three seconds. Additionally use Serial.println() to print if the LED is on or off.

### [2018-09-28](Class%20Examples/2018-09-28/)
* Review 3 seconds light hw
* Review the functions we've covered so far, Serial.begin, Serial.println, delay, pinMode, digitalRead, digitalWrite, analogWrite
* Introduce for loops

### [2018-10-01](Class%20Examples/2018-10-01/)
* Review for loops
* Consider possible issues with for loops (never execute, infinite loop, typos)
* Loop through LEDs
* HW: Modify the code from class so that when you push the button, each led turns on and off in sequence. See the video for an example. https://youtu.be/jLKJBXgc0ik
