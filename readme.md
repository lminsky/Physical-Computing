# Physical Computing (2018-2019) 
Louis Minsky - lminsky@packer.edu  
Room G076  

### Course Description
Computers have become interwoven in all aspects of our lives. In addition to laptops and smartphones, we now have fitness trackers, intelligent thermostats, web connected door locks, and self driving cars. In this class students will investigate how computers interact with the physical world and how humans interact with computers. Students will write programs that function beyond the limits of a keyboard, mouse, and screen. We will begin by learning basic electronics before moving into an exploration of motors, lights, speakers and a wide range of sensors. We will finish the course by considering real world problems and then designing and building devices to improve the world.

### Texts, Software, and Supplies
We'll be using Make: Learn Electronics with Arduino by Jody Culkin and Eric Hagan. Any additional required material will be distributed either as a handout or posted online. We have a wide variety of electrical components available in the Tech Center.

### Grading
Your grade will be calculated as a fraction of the total points available. You may revise homework up to one week after it is returned for a grade up to a 90. Late homework will not get above an 80. You will receive a point for participation each day. Things you could do to not earn that point include, but are not limited to, skipping class, playing games, wearing headphones.
